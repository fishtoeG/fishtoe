#### App Description:
This app comes in three separate versions, all of which contain a simple and effective deck of vocabulary flashcards that will help prepare you for different exams. Each app is specifically tailored to the respective exam (SAT/ACT, GRE, or TOEFL/IELTS) and contains 600-800 important vocabulary words routinely included in that particular exam. The vocabulary flashcards in each app contain the wordâ€™s definition, audio pronunciation, synonyms, usage examples, and (if available) etymology (root) of the relevant word. In addition, there are translations for English to Chinese, Spanish, Japanese and Korean languages, a feature particularly helpful for ESL (English as a Secondary Language) students. After studying a given word/flashcard, the word can tested in a quiz.
